**Project Overview**:

This project provides a Python-based script to automate operations on a Kubernetes cluster, including:

1. Connecting to a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Installing and configuring necessary tools like Helm and KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaler).
3. Deploying applications with event-driven scaling capabilities.
4. Continuously monitoring the health status of a deployment, including real-time updates for pod states, CPU, and memory usage.
5. The script is designed to work on a bare Kubernetes cluster and can be executed in local or cloud-based environments like Minikube or managed Kubernetes services.

**Features**:

1. Cluster Connection: Establishes connection to the Kubernetes cluster using kubectl and Python Kubernetes API client.
2. Helm and KEDA Installation: Automates the installation of Helm and KEDA using Helm charts.
3. Application Deployment: Creates a Kubernetes deployment, service, and KEDA ScaledObject for autoscaling based on resource usage or external events.
4. Health Monitoring: Provides real-time updates for deployment health, including pod states and resource metrics (CPU, Memory).
5. Error Handling: Includes comprehensive error handling for robust automation.
   
**Prerequisites**:
1. Kubernetes Cluster:
2. A running Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, GKE, EKS).
3. Metrics Server installed for resource usage monitoring.
   
**Tools:**:
1. kubectl: Command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes.
2. Helm: Kubernetes package manager.
3. Python: Python 3.9+.
4. Required Python libraries: kubernetes.
   
**Installation**:
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>

Install Python dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure Kubernetes credentials are configured:
kubectl get nodes

**Usage:**

**Run the Script:**

python script.py

**Default Configuration:**
The script deploys a sample application (nginx) with default configurations.

**Health Monitoring:**
Continuously monitors the health of the deployment until all pods are Running.
Environment Configuration

Edit Deployment Parameters:

Modify the deployment parameters in script.py:

deployment_name = "example-app"
namespace = "default"
image = "nginx:latest"
cpu_request = "100m"
memory_request = "128Mi"
cpu_limit = "200m"
memory_limit = "256Mi"
ports = [80]
scale_metric_type = "cpu"
scale_metric_value = "50"
Optional: Dynamic Inputs: Add CLI arguments to make the script dynamic using argparse.

**Troubleshooting**
Metrics Unavailable:

Ensure Metrics Server is installed and running:
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
Add --kubelet-insecure-tls to the Metrics Server deployment if using Minikube.

Kubernetes API Errors:

Verify cluster access:

kubectl get nodes
Ensure necessary permissions are granted:

kubectl create clusterrolebinding admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=<your-user>

**Future Enhancements**
Integration with external event sources (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for KEDA triggers.
Full CI/CD pipeline automation for deployment updates.
Support for multiple namespaces and environments.
